 * WiseBox: The Swiss Army Knife of Smart Contracts
 *
 * WiseBox combines tiny versions of many common smart contract utilities into
 * a single MAST contract. It provides convenient access to the most commonly
 * used contract utilities.
 *
 * WiseBox has been written with size-optimization and limited resources in
 * mind. It is also extremely efficient due to its use of merkentelized trees.
 * This makes it easy to simply drop-in to ANY project and GO!
 *
 * NOTES
 * --------------------
 * The following is a preliminary list of smart contract (utility) methods:
 *   - timestamp locks
 *   - block height locks
 *   - for-loop
 *   - while-loop
 *
 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
